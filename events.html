Senanayaka Central College, Madampe<br>
Organizing Committee ‚Äì Student Activities and Events<br>

At Senanayaka Central College, we value and respect the privacy of all students participating in school-organized events, programs, and competitions. As part of our commitment to creating a safe, supportive, and transparent environment, the Organizing Committee has developed this privacy policy to inform students and their guardians about how we collect, use, store, and protect personal information throughout the course of school activities.

üìå Purpose of the Policy<br>
This policy aims to ensure that students' personal information is handled responsibly and in accordance with accepted data protection principles. We want to assure participants and their families that their information will only be used for legitimate educational and organizational purposes, and that we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of this data.

Emergency contact details

Medical or accessibility needs (only when necessary for safety)

Academic or performance-related details (e.g., competition results)

Media content such as photographs and video recordings

All information collected is relevant to the nature of the event and is collected with consent.

Participation in events implies consent to the use of media content for these purposes. However, parents or guardians who do not wish their child‚Äôs images to be used publicly may inform the organizing committee in writing prior to the event.

üîê Data Protection and Security<br>
All personal data is stored securely and is accessible only to authorized staff members. We take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse of student information. Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy.
